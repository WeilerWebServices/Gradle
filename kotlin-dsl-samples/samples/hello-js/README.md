Hello, JavaScript!
==================

This sample demonstrates a simple JavaScript application with a Kotlin based build script.

Simply import the Gradle project by pointing to the `setting.gradle` file.

Build the project with `./gradlew build` to create the JavaScript-File (output is `./build/web/`).

Open the `./build/web/index.html` and check the Browser's console for output.
