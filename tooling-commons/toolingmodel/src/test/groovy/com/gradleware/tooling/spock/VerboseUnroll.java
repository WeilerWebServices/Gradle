/**
 * Indicates that iterations of a data-driven feature should be made visible as separate features to the outside
 * world (IDEs, reports, etc.). By default, the name of an iteration is the feature's name followed by the data
 * values of the current iteration. Example of the output for a given iteration:
 * <pre>
 * calculateTimeSpan [14:55, 15:05, 600, SECONDS]
 * calculateTimeSpan [14:55, 15:05, 10, MINUTES]</pre>
 *
 * The feature's name can be replaced by providing a naming pattern after {@code VerboseUnroll}. A naming pattern
 * may refer to data variables by prepending their names with #.
 *
 * The {@code VerboseUnroll} annotation can also be put on a spec class. This has the same effect as putting it on
 * every data-driven feature method that is not already annotated with {@code VerboseUnroll}. By embedding the naming
 * pattern in the method names, each method can still have its own pattern.
 *
 * Note: this class has been derived from {@code spock.lang.Unroll} which is available in library
 * {@code spock-core-0.7-groovy-2.0.jar} under the Apache License 2.0.
