= Gradle Documentation Plugins

This is a collection of very opinionated plugins that support the authoring of documentations for Gradle.

* `org.gradle.guides`: The single guide project plugin.
* `org.gradle.samples`: The samples plugin.
* `org.gradle.documentation`: Used to generate all type of documentation (currently only guides and samples).

== How do I use the plugins?

Each of the plugins generates a guide from Asciidoc source.

=== Guide

- The source for the guide is located in `content/index.adoc`
- Run `./gradlew guidesMultiPage` to generate the guide into `build/working/guides/render-guides/<name-of-guide>/index.html`.
- Run `./gradlew view<NameOfGuide>Guide` to generate the guide and open it in the browser.
- Run `./gradlew check` to execute all guide check.
