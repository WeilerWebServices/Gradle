=== Fedora

As of Fedora 19, Jetty 9 is the version of Jetty available.
This distribution of Jetty is not created or maintained by the Jetty project though we have had a fair amount of communication with the folks behind it and we are very pleased with how this Linux distribution has stayed current.
Releases are kept largely in sync with our releases as there is a wonderful automatic notification mechanism in place for Fedora that detects our releases and immediately opens an issue for them to update.
