[[embedded-secured-hello-handler]]
==== Secured Hello Handler

This example shows how to wrap one handler with another one that handles security.
We have a simple Hello Handler that just return a greeting but add on the restriction that to get this greeting you must authenticate.
Another thing to remember is that this example uses the `ConstraintSecurityHandler` which is what supports the security mappings inside of the servlet api, it could be easier to show just the `SecurityHandler` usage, but the constraint provides more configuration power.
If you don't need that you can drop the Constraint bits and use just the `SecurityHandler`.
