[[embedded-file-server]]
==== Simple File Server

This example shows how to create a simple file server in Jetty.
It is perfectly suitable for test cases where you need an actual web server to obtain a file from, it could easily be configured to serve files from a directory under `src/test/resources`.
Note that this does not have any logic for caching of files, either within the server or setting the appropriate headers on the response.
It is simply a few lines that illustrate how easy it is to serve out some files.

===== Run it!

After you have started things up you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:8080/index.html (assuming one is in the resource base directory) and you are good to go.

===== Maven Coordinates

To use this example in your project you will need the following Maven dependencies declared.
