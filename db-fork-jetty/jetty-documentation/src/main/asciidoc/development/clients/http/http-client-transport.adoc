[[http-client-transport]]
=== Pluggable Transports

Jetty's HTTP client can be configured to use different transports to carry the semantic of HTTP requests and responses.

This means that the intention of a client to request resource `/index.html` using the `GET` method can be carried over the network in different formats.

A HTTP client transport is the component that is in charge of converting a high-level, semantic, HTTP requests such as "GET resource /index.html" into the specific format understood by the server (for example, HTTP/2), and to convert the server response from the specific format (HTTP/2) into high-level, semantic objects that can be used by applications.

In this way, applications are not aware of the actual protocol being used.
This allows them to write their logic against a high-level API that hides the details of the specific protocol being used over the network.

The most common protocol format is HTTP/1.1, a text-based protocol with lines separated by `\r\n`:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: domain.com\r\n
...
\r\n
----

However, the same request can be made using FastCGI, a binary protocol:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
x01 x01 x00 x01 x00 x08 x00 x00
x00 x01 x01 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00
x01 x04 x00 x01 xLL xLL x00 x00
x0C x0B  D   O   C   U   M   E
 N   T   _   U   R   I   /   i
 n   d   e   x   .   h   t   m
 l
...
----

Similarly, HTTP/2 is a binary protocol that transports the same information in a yet different format.

==== HTTP/1.1 Transport

HTTP/1.1 is the default transport.

[source, java, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
// No transport specified, using default.
HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
client.start();
----

If you want to customize the HTTP/1.1 transport, you can explicitly configure `HttpClient` in this way:

[source, java, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
int selectors = 1;
HttpClientTransportOverHTTP transport = new HttpClientTransportOverHTTP(selectors);

HttpClient client = new HttpClient(transport, null);
client.start();
----

The example above allows you to customize the number of NIO selectors that `HttpClient` will be using.

==== HTTP/2 Transport

The HTTP/2 transport can be configured in this way:

[source, java, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
HTTP2Client h2Client = new HTTP2Client();
h2Client.setSelectors(1);
HttpClientTransportOverHTTP2 transport = new HttpClientTransportOverHTTP2(h2Client);

HttpClient client = new HttpClient(transport, null);
client.start();
----

`HTTP2Client` is the lower-level client that provides an API based on HTTP/2 concepts such as _sessions_, _streams_ and _frames_ that are specific to HTTP/2.

`HttpClientTransportOverHTTP2` uses `HTTP2Client` to format high-level semantic HTTP requests ("GET resource /index.html") into the HTTP/2 specific format.

==== FastCGI Transport

The FastCGI transport can be configured in this way:

[source, java, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
int selectors = 1;
String scriptRoot = "/var/www/wordpress";
HttpClientTransportOverFCGI transport = new HttpClientTransportOverFCGI(selectors, false, scriptRoot);

HttpClient client = new HttpClient(transport, null);
client.start();
----

In order to make requests using the FastCGI transport, you need to have a FastCGI server such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#PHPFPM[PHP-FPM] (see also http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php).

The FastCGI transport is primarily used by Jetty's link:#fastcgi[FastCGI support] to serve PHP pages (WordPress for example).
