== Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)

The development of new web protocols such as HTTP/2 raised the need of protocol
negotiation within a Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake.
A protocol negotiation called ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation -
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301[RFC7301]) has been defined to accomplish this.

ALPN has now replaced the older (and now fully deprecated) NPN in the general Web
as of 2016.

For those browsers that support HTTP/2, they all now support ALPN.
Starting with Jetty 9.3.0, only ALPN is supported by Jetty.
