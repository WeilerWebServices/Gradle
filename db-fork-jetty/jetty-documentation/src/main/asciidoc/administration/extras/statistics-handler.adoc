[[statistics-handler]]
=== Statistics Handler

[[statistics-handler-metadata]]
==== Info

* Classname: `org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.StatisticsHandler`
* Maven Artifact: org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server
* Javadoc: {JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/StatisticsHandler.html

[[statistics-handler-usage]]
==== Usage

Jetty currently has two levels of request statistic collection:

* Subclasses of `AbstractConnector` class optionally can collect statistics about connections as well as number of requests.
* The `StatisticsHandler` class may be used to collect request statistics.

In addition to these, subclasses of the `SessionHandler` and `DefaultSessionCache` classes optionally can collect session statistics.

`AbstractConnector`, `SessionHandler` and `DefaultSessionCache` statistics are turned off by default and must either be configured manually for each instance or turned on via JMX interface.
The `StatisticsHandler` is not included in default Jetty configuration, and needs to be configured manually.

_____
[NOTE]
To view statistics, you have to be able to connect to Jetty using either JConsole or some other JMX agent. See xref:using-jmx[] for more information.

[[connector-statistics]]
==== Connector statistics

Detailed statistics on connection duration and number of requests are only collated when a connection is closed.
The current and maximum number of connections are the only "live" statistics.
//To learn how to turn on connector statistics please see the Jetty Statistics tutorial, although this is not recommended and it is best to use a JMX agent to select statistics only when needed.

The following example shows how to turn on connector statistics in Jetty xml.
This example comes from within `jetty-http.xml`.

[source, xml, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
  <Call name="addConnector">
    <Arg>
      <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.ServerConnector">
        <Arg name="server"><Ref refid="Server" /></Arg>
        <Arg name="factories">
          <Array type="org.eclipse.jetty.server.ConnectionFactory">
            <Item>
              <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpConnectionFactory">
                <Arg name="config"><Ref refid="httpConfig" /></Arg>
              </New>
            </Item>
          </Array>
        </Arg>
        <Set name="host"><Property name="jetty.host" /></Set>
        <Set name="port"><Property name="jetty.http.port" default="8080" /></Set>
        <Set name="idleTimeout">30000</Set>
        <!-- Enable Connection Statistics -->
        <Call name="addBean">
          <Arg>
              <New id="ConnectionStatistics" class="org.eclipse.jetty.io.ConnectionStatistics"/>
          </Arg>
        </Call>
      </New>
    </Arg>
  </Call>

[[request-statistics]]
==== Request Statistics

To collect request statistics a `StatisticsHandler` must be configured as one of the handlers of the server.
Typically this can be done as the top level handler, but you may choose to configure a statistics handler for just one context by creating a context configuration file.
You can enable the `StatisticsHandler` by activating the `stats` modules on the command line.

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....
$ java -jar {$jetty.home}/start.jar --add-to-start=stats
....

Alternately, if you are making multiple changes to the Jetty configuration, you could include statistics handler configuration into your own Jetty xml configuration.
The following fragment shows how to configure a top level statistics handler:

[source, xml, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
    <Get id="oldhandler" name="handler" />
  <Set name="handler">
    <New id="StatsHandler" class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.StatisticsHandler">
      <Set name="handler"><Ref refid="oldhandler" /></Set>
    </New>
  </Set>
----

[[session-statistics]]
==== Session Statistics

Session handling is built into Jetty for any servlet or webapp context.
Detailed statistics on session duration are only collated when a session is closed.
The current, minimum, and maximum number of sessions are the only "live" statistics.
The session statistics are enabled by default and do not need to be configured.
