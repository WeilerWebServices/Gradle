=== Persistent Sessions: Inifinspan

==== Enabling Infinispan Sessions

When using the Jetty distribution, you will first need to enable the `session-store-infinispan-remote` link:#startup-modules[module] for your link:#startup-base-and-home[Jetty base] using the `--add-to-start` argument on the command line.

____
[IMPORTANT]
If you are running Jetty with JDK 9 or greater, enable `session-store-infinispan-remote-910.mod` instead.

Doing this enables the remote Infinispan Session module and any dependent modules or files needed for it to run on the server.
The example above is using a fresh `${jetty.base}` with nothing else enabled.
Because Infinispan is not a technology provided by the Eclipse Foundation, users are prompted to assent to the licenses of the external vendor (Apache in this case).

When the `--add-to-start` argument was added to the command line, it enabled the the `session-store-infinispan-remote` module as well as the `sessions` and `server` modules, which are required for Infinispan session management to operate.
It also downloaded the needed Infinispan-specific jar files and created a directory named `${jetty.base}/lib/infinispan/` to house them.

In addition to adding these modules to the classpath of the server it also added several ini configuration files to the `${jetty.base}/start.d` directory.

____
[NOTE]
If you have updated versions of the jar files automatically downloaded by Jetty, you can place them in the associated `${jetty.base}/lib/` directory and use the `--skip-file-validation=<module name>` command line option to prevent errors when starting your server.

==== Configuring Inifinspan Remote Properties

Opening the `start.d/session-store-infinispan-remote.ini` will show a list of all the configurable options for the JDBC module:

# ---------------------------------------
# Module: session-store-infinispan-remote
# Enables session data store in a remote Infinispan cache
# ---------------------------------------
--module=session-store-infinispan-remote

#jetty.session.infinispan.remoteCacheName=sessions
#jetty.session.infinispan.idleTimeout.seconds=0
#jetty.session.gracePeriod.seconds=3600
#jetty.session.savePeriod.seconds=0
----

jetty.session.infinispan.remoteCacheName::
Name of the cache in Infinispan where sessions will be stored.
jetty.session.infinispan.idleTimeout.seconds::
Amount of time, in seconds, that the system allows the connector to remain idle before closing the connection.
jetty.session.gracePeriod.seconds::
Amount of time, in seconds, to wait for other nodes to be checked to verify an expired session is in fact expired throughout the cluster before closing it.
jetty.session.savePeriod.seconds=0::
By default whenever the last concurrent request leaves a session, that session is always persisted via the `SessionDataStore`, even if the only thing that changed on the session is its updated last access time.
A non-zero value means that the `SessionDataStore` will skip persisting the session if only the access time changed, and it has been less than `savePeriod` seconds since the last time the session was written.
+
____
[NOTE]
Configuring `savePeriod` is useful if your persistence technology is very slow/costly for writes.
In a clustered environment, there is a risk of the last access time of the session being out-of-date in the shared store for up to `savePeriod` seconds.
This allows the possibility that a node may prematurely expire the session, even though it is in use by another node.
Thorough consideration of the `maxIdleTime` of the session when setting the `savePeriod` is imperative - there is no point in setting a `savePeriod` that is larger than the `maxIdleTime`.

==== Configuring Embedded Inifinspan Clustering

During testing, it can be helpful to run an in-process instance of Infinispan.
To enable this you will first need to enable the `session-store-infinispan-embedded` link:#startup-modules[module] for your link:#startup-base-and-home[Jetty base] using the `--add-to-start` argument on the command line.

____
[IMPORTANT]
If you are running Jetty with JDK 9 or greater, enable `session-store-infinispan-embedded-910.mod` instead.

==== Converting session format for jetty-9.4.13

From jetty-9.4.13 onwards, we have changed the format of the serialized session when using a remote cache (ie using hotrod).
Prior to release 9.4.13 we used the default Infinispan serialization, however this was not able to store sufficient information to allow jetty to properly deserialize session attributes in all circumstances.
See issue https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/2919 for more background.

We have provided a conversion program which will convert any sessions stored in Infinispan to the new format.
____
[IMPORTANT]
We recommend that you backup your stored sessions before running the conversion program.
____

How to use the converter:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
java -cp servlet-api-3.1.jar:jetty-util-9.4.13.jar:jetty-server-9.4.13.jar:infinispan-remote-9.1.0.Final.jar:jetty-infinispan-9.4.13.jar:[other classpath]  org.eclipse.jetty.session.infinispan.InfinispanSessionLegacyConverter

Usage:  InfinispanSessionLegacyConverter [-Dhost=127.0.0.1] [-Dverbose=true|false] <cache-name> [check]
----

The classpath::
Must contain the servlet-api, jetty-util, jetty-server, jetty-infinispan and infinispan-remote jars. If your sessions contain attributes that use application classes, you will also need to also put those classes onto the classpath. If your session has been authenticated, you may also need to include the jetty-security and jetty-http jars on the classpath.
Parameters::
When used with no arguments the usage message is printed. When used with the `cache-name` parameter the conversion is performed. When used with both `cache-name` and `check` parameters, sessions are checked for whether or not they are converted.

 -Dhost:::  you can optionally provide a system property with the address of your remote Infinispan server. Defaults to the localhost.
 -Dverbose::: defaults to false. If true, prints more comprehensive stacktrace information about failures. Useful to diagnose why a session is not converted.
 cache-name::: the name of the remote cache containing your sessions. This is mandatory.
 check::: the optional check command will verify sessions have been converted. Use it _after_ doing the conversion.

To perform the conversion, run the InfinispanSessionLegacyConverter with just the `cache-name`, and optionally the `host` system property.
The following command will attempt to convert all sessions in the cached named `my-remote-cache` on the machine `myhost`, ensuring that application classes in the `/my/custom/classes` directory are on the classpath:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
java -cp servlet-api-3.1.jar:jetty-util-9.4.13.jar:jetty-server-9.4.13.jar:infinispan-remote-9.1.0.Final.jar:jetty-infinispan-9.4.13.jar:/my/custom/classes  org.eclipse.jetty.session.infinispan.InfinispanSessionLegacyConverter -Dhost=myhost my-remote-cache
----

If the converter fails to convert a session, an error message and stacktrace will be printed and the conversion will abort. The failed session should be untouched, however _it is prudent to take a backup of your cache before attempting the conversion_.
