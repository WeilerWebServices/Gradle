=== Quick Setup

If you are using the standard distribution of Jetty, you must enable the _JNDI_ link:#startup-modules[module] to obtain Jetty's JNDI implementation, and the *plus* link:#startup-modules[module] which provides classes for interacting with JNDI.
As the _plus_ module depends on the _JNDI_ module, you only need to enable the _plus_ module to enable both.
Assuming you have Jetty installed in `/opt/jetty`, and you have made a link:#startup-base-and-home[jetty base] in `/opt/jetty/my-base`, do:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....
cd /opt/jetty
cd my-base
java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-to-start=plus
....

You can now start Jetty and use JNDI within your webapps.
See link:#using-jndi[Using JNDI] for information on how to add entries to the JNDI environment that Jetty can look up within webapps.

If you have extra jars associated with your JNDI resources, for example a database driver jar, and you haven't made a custom link:#startup-modules[module] for it, you can put the jars into your `{$jetty base}ext/` directory.
You will then need to enable the _ext_ module to ensure the jars in the `ext/` directory are on the classpath.
Assuming you have Jetty installed in `/opt/jetty`, and you have made a link:#startup-base-and-home[jetty base] in `/opt/jetty/my-base`, do:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....
cd /opt/jetty
cd my-base
java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-to-start=ext
....
