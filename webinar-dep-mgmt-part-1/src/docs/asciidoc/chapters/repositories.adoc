== Getting dependencies

=== From a repository to your machine

Gradle attaches importance to the source of a dependency, its origin repository.

Gradle has lots of smarts in order to optimise the downloading of files.

=== Repositories

* Order of repositories _is important_
* Use repository filtering for partitioning sources
* Avoid _mavenLocal()_
** Not strictly a repository, but a cache for Maven
** Sometimes contains partial module data, this will trip Gradle
* Metadata and artifacts downloaded concurrently

=== How Gradle searches for binaries

* Gradle _knows_ where an artifact comes from
* Get the SHA1 of the artifact (GET or HEAD)
* Looks in its dependency cache if something at the same GAV has the same hash
** If so, uses it
* Can leverage local maven repository content instead of downloading
** That is transparent, and different than having `mavenLocal()` declared as a repository

Consequence: if you get a file from _Maven Central_, then you change the repository to _JCenter_, if the artifacts are the same, downloaded only once.
