== Core concepts

=== Definitions


* *Module*
** A piece of software that evolves over time
** Has a group, name and version to identify it
** Example: `org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.2`
* *Configuration* +
In the context of dependency management, and for most users:
** Named set of dependencies
** Provides access to resolved modules and their artifacts
** Example: `implementation`

=== API and implementation

=== More bucket configurations

image::configurations/bucket_2.png[width=100%, height=100%]

=== Bucket configurations relationship

image::configurations/bucket_3.png[width=100%, height=100%]

=== API vs implementation

* To _build_ a module, you need:
** `api`, `implementation` and `compileOnly` dependencies
* To _run_ a module, you need:
** `api`, `implementation` and `runtimeOnly` dependencies

=== Classpath configurations

image::configurations/classpath.png[width=100%, heighth=100%]

=== API vs implementation transitively

* To _build against_ a module, you need:
** transitive `api` dependencies
* To _run against_ a module, you need:
** transitive `api`, `implementation` and `runtimeOnly` dependencies

=== Elements configurations

=== Configurations

* 3 kinds of configurations

** "buckets" of dependencies
** resolvable configurations
** consumable configurations

=== Buckets of dependencies


* A named list of dependencies
* `canBeConsumed=false` +
  `canBeResolved=false`

=== Resolvable configurations


* Represents a _consumer_
* For a specific _usage_ (compiling, runtime, ...)
* Extends from one or more bucket(s)
* `canBeConsumed=false` +
  `canBeResolved=true`

=== Consumable configurations


* Represents a variant of a _producer_
* Attaches _artifacts_
* Extends from one or more bucket
* `canBeConsumed=true` +
  `canBeResolved=false`

=== Matching consumers with producers

Gradle needs a way to perform the matching between consumers and producers.

Attributes and variants are the answer.

=== More definitions

* *Attribute*
** Named
** Typed
** Can have compatibility and disambiguation rules
* *Variant*
** A consumable form of a module
** Declare artifacts and / or dependencies
** Identified by its attributes and their values

=== Gradle attributes

* `org.gradle.usage`: indicates the _usage_ of a variant
** Example: `java-api` or `java-runtime`
* `org.gradle.category`: indicates the _category_ of a component
** Example: `library` or `platform`
* `org.gradle.dependency.bundling`: indicates how _dependencies_ are handled
** Example: `regular` or `embedded`

=== Gradle JVM attributes

* `org.gradle.jvm.version`: indicates the minimal JVM version compatibility
** Example: `6`, `9` or `12`

=== Usage of attributes

* Can be declared on configurations
** Defines an _expected_ value on resolvable
** Defines an _exposed_ value on consumable
* Can be declared on dependencies
** Overrides the configuration value (if set)
* Can be declared when retrieving artifact

=== Semantics and dependencies

Gradle has a strong modelling of dependencies:

* Semantic difference between compilation and runtime
* Semantic difference between building a library and building _against_ a library
* Ability for a module to produce more than one variant
