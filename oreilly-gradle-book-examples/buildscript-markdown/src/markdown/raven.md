## Text

> Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
> Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
> While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
> As of someone gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door
> "'Tis some visitor," I muttered. "Tapping at my chamber door.
> "Only this, and nothing more."
> 
> ```Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December
> And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
> Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
> From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore
> For that rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore--
> Nameless here forevermore.```
