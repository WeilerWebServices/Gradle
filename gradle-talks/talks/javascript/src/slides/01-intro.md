Managing JavaScript

# Gradle & JS?

## JavaScript…

* Growing relevance, to everyone
* Weak history of tooling and build automation

## Automation…

* Bundling
* Minification
* Testing
* Code Analysis 
* *Reuse*

We now create JavaScript libraries, not scripts.

## then (1 year ago) …

* No build time dependency management conventions
* No well established structural/process conventions

Adhoc automation.

## now…

* Node.js
* NPM
* GruntJS
* Yeoman
* Bower.js
* JamJS

Maturing quickly.

## Gradle? 

* Who orchestrates the entire project?
* How do you provision the backend?

Front end tools don't do whole project automation.

## Gradle? 

Where specialist tools exist, integrate instead of replace.
