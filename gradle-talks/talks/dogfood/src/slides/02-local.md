## Design Process

* Some design up front
* Every commit is reviewed (http://code-review.gradle.org)
* No feature branches (spikes ok)
* Regular small commits
* Adhoc pairing (remote)
* Test/document as you go (incl. release notes)

## Development tooling

* Gradle
* Git (GitHub)
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Spock Test Framework
* TeamCity
* Markdown & Docbook
* HipChat

# Development

Automating the day-to-day

## Dev environment

* ./gradlew idea
* OS images (coming)
* No external dependencies

## Testing

* IDE execution
* Custom runners
* Investment in fixtures
* Performance (historical)

## Documentation

* API ref
* DSL ref
* Userguide
* Samples
* Release notes
* Analytics

## Release notes

* Markdown
* Structure
* “Checkstyle”
* “Fixed issues”

## Code Quality

* Ensure public API is documented
* License headers
* Cyclical package dependencies
* Static analysis (Checkstyle & Codenarc)
