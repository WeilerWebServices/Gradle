`script.gradle` allows to build multiple variants of a Scala library targeting different Scala runtimes. Shared dependencies can be added to the `compile` and `runtime` configurations. Dependency names ending in `_?` will have the `?` replaced with the Scala version that's being targeted. It's also possible to explicitly choose different dependencies depending on the target runtime. `gradlew assemble` will build all variants.
