Clone https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration-dsl-scala, update it to use latest Gradle, and locate the following in the top-level build.gradle:

...
  tasks.withType(ScalaCompile) {
    scalaCompileOptions.useAnt = true
  }

Run a clean compile (`gradlew cleanCompileScala compileScala`). Make a source code change to the `core` project and recompile (`gradlew compileScala`). Repeat with `useAnt = false`, which will make use of compiler daemon and Zinc incremental compiler.
