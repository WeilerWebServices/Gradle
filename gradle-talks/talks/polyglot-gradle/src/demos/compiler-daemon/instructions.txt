Clone https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration, update it to use latest Gradle, and add the following to the top-level build.gradle:

allprojects {
    tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
        options.useAnt = true
        options.fork = true
    }
}

First run `gradlew compileJava` with `useAnt = true`, then with `useAnt = false`. The latter will use the compiler daemon.
