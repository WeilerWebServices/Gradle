# Looking forward

Some things in the pipelineâ€¦

## Dependency management

We are continuing to add new dependency management features, primarily for conflict control and precision.

Also working on a new model to cover:

* Variants
* Publication types (beyond single file)
* Context sensitive dependency consumption

## JavaScript

* Improved core support
* Improved integration with JS tools (e.g. GruntJS, NPM)

## IDE Support

Android SDK is pushing the boundaries of build/IDE integration.

Expect to see many improvements in next 12 months.

## Community Plugins

Sharing infrastructure to make it easier to find and use Gradle plugins.

## Enterprise scalability

Gradle 2.0 will support very large scale projects.

This will also benefit smaller projects.
