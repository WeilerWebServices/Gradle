# (Title) Gradle in the Enterprise.
## Agenda
(Abstract) Gradle is rapidly becoming the defacto automation tool of choice for enterprises in the software development pipeline .... but why?

After a brief introduction to Gradle we will explore some of the common enterprise pain points and illustrate how Gradle addresses these issues.

* Introduction to Gradle syntax and the java family of plugins 
* "The Customer is always right" - codify enterprise conventions - main/test source tree.
* "Reproduciblity" - wrapper checked into source tree.
* "Scale - work avoidance" - scaling by not doing the work again. Demo the DAG, maybe the fibonacci.
* "Scale - parallel builds" - 
* "Enterprise policy" - forbidding http foo, mandating http blah repo.
* "Enterprise metrics" - discovery and analytics to offer feedback for even greater efficiency games.
* "Standardization" - use the gradle toolkit to bring good stuff to xcodebuild or android or blackberry or msbuild or ..
* "Automate Everything" - talk about non-java (C++/Andriod) and non-build (userguides and web sites) use cases for gradle.
