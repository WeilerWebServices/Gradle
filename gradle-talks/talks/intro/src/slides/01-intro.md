## The Philosophy

* Conventions are good, malleable conventions are better (no “one way”).
* Automation should be ambitious, not forced into conformance.
* Declarative where possible, imperative where necessary.
* User conventions are first class citizens.
* User extensions are first class citizens.

**This is far from a solved domain, plenty of potential for innovation.**

Continuous delivery is pushing us to squeeze every bit of automation out the lifecycle. Good automation is a competitive advantage.

## The Vision

### Automation beyond compile/test/upload.

The “build system” is in a priviliged position to *express* and orchestrate more of the software lifecycle. 

### Local build empowerment

The CI loop is a bottleneck. Developers need more power locally.

### “The Toolkit” of choice

Next generation dependency management, build performance, reusable abstractions.

Objective: become the clear choice for complex software delivery automation.
