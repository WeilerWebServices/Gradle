== Strategies for publication

=== Declared vs published

* Your build file declares a number of _versions_
** e.g., `commons-lang3:3.3`
* Not necessarily the resolved one:
** e.g., `commons-lang3:3.3 -> 3.4 (conflict resolution)`

=== Declared vs published

* What about dynamic dependencies?
* e.g. `commons-lang3:3.+`
* Gradle lets you choose between two modes: declared or resolved versions
** defaults to the _declared versions_

=== Declared versions

* Pros
** Effectively what you need
** Maximum expressiveness thanks to rich versions
* Cons
** Requires diligence in what is declared
** Result may be very different

=== Resolved versions

* Pros
** What you resolve is what you get
** Stable resolution for consumers (no dynamic)
* Cons
** Lossy mapping (ranges disappear, for example)
** Maybe unintentional
** Always approximate (what resolution to use?)
** Maybe incorrect (e.g. substitutions)

=== Resolved rich versions

* Makes the mapping lossy for Gradle as well
* flattens to `require` or `strictly`
** if the declared version is strictly, the resolved is as well

=== How to

```
publishing {
    publications {
        create<MavenPublication>("mavenJava") {
            versionMapping {
                usage("java-api") {
                    fromResolutionOf("runtimeClasspath")
                }
                usage("java-runtime") {
                    fromResolutionResult()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

=== Relationship with dependency locking

* Locking guarantees same resolution result
* But lock files are _unknown_ to consumers
* Using locking + resolved result makes sense

=== Future work on resolved versions

* More strategies
** still publish ranges, _prefer_ the resolved version
** fail if resolved version disagrees with declared version

=== Release strategies

=== Gradle is agnostic

* Version is _simply_ a `project` property
* Open as to _where_ to publish

=== Which version to release?

* `-SNAPSHOT`, based on the Maven convention
** _Changing_ aspect is a problem for reproducibility
* Unique releases
** Keeping up with releases requires work / automation

=== Where to publish?

* Maven local repository
** Convenient but not without issues
** Consider using repository content filtering to limit its impact
* Repository (local or remote)
** Requires more infrastructure

=== Strategies

* Live with the `-SNAPSHOT` limitations
* Use dynamic versions and locking for easier automated updates
** Add publication of resolved versions

=== Integrations

* During development, integration can use:
** Publication and releases
** Composite builds
** Source dependencies

=== Plugins can help

* `nebula-release-plugin` supports multiple release types
** Integrates with Git
** final, candidate, snapshots, unique snapshots, ...
** Give it a try!

=== Multi repository development

This is really where all these concepts come into play _inside_ an organisation.
