= {project-name} - Using Kotlin

https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin] is a very popular programming language that targets the JVM (amongst other environments). Kotlin has experienced a surge in popularity the last few years making it the most popular JVM language, except for Java of course.

{project-name} provides first class support for using Kotlin as will be explained in this guide.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 10 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+



== Creating the Maven project

First, we need a new Kotlin project. This can be done using the following command:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=rest-kotlin \
    -DclassName="org.acme.rest.GreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/greeting" \
    -Dextensions="kotlin"
----

When adding `kotlin` to the extensions list, the Maven plugin will generate a project that is properly
configured to work with Kotlin. Furthermore  the `org.acme.rest.GreetingResource` class is implemented as Kotlin source code (as is the case with the generated tests).

`GreetingResource.kt` looks like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
package org.acme.rest

import javax.ws.rs.GET
import javax.ws.rs.Path
import javax.ws.rs.Produces
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType

@Path("/greeting")
class GreetingResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    fun hello() = "hello"
}
----

== Important configuration points

The generated `pom.xml` contains the following modifications compared to its counterpart when Kotlin is not selected:

* The `quarkus-kotlin` artifact is added to the dependencies. This artifact provides support for Kotlin in the live reload mode (more about this later on)
* The `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` is also added as a dependency.
* Maven's `sourceDirectory` and `testSourceDirectory` build properties are configured to point to Kotlin sources (`src/main/kotlin` and `src/test/kotlin` respectively)
* The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is configured as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>kotlin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
    <version>${kotlin.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>compile</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>compile</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>test-compile</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>test-compile</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <compilerPlugins>
            <plugin>all-open</plugin>
        </compilerPlugins>

        <pluginOptions>
            <!-- Each annotation is placed on its own line -->
            <option>all-open:annotation=javax.ws.rs.Path</option>
        </pluginOptions>
    </configuration>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
            <artifactId>kotlin-maven-allopen</artifactId>
            <version>${kotlin.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
----

The important thing to note is the use of the https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#all-open-compiler-plugin[all-open] Kotlin compiler plugin.
In order to understand why this plugin is needed, first we need to note that by default all the classes generated from the Kotlin compiler are marked as `final`.

Having `final` classes however does not work well with various frameworks that need to create https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/reflection/proxy.html[Dynamic Proxies].

Thus, the `all-open` Kotlin compiler plugin allows us to configure the compiler to *not* mark as `final` classes that have certain annotations. In the snippet above,
we have specified that classes annotated with `javax.ws.rs.Path` should not be `final`.

If your application contains classes annotated with `javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped`
for example, then `<option>all-open:annotation=javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped</option>` needs to be added as well. Same goes for any class that needs to have a dynamic proxy created at runtime.

Future versions of {project-name} will configure the Kotlin compiler plugin in a way that will make it unnecessary to alter this configuration.

== Live reload

{project-name} provides support for live reloading changes made to source code. This support is also available to Kotlin, meaning that developers can update their Kotlin source
code and immediately see their changes reflected.

To see this feature in action, first execute: `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev`

When executing an HTTP GET request against `http://localhost:8080/greeting`, you should get `hello` as a response.

Now using your favorite editor or IDE, update `GreetingResource.kt` and change the `hello` method to the following:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun hello() = "hi"
----

When you now execute an HTTP GET request against `http://localhost:8080/greeting`, you should see `hi` as a response.

One thing to note is that the live reload feature is not available when making changes to both Java and Kotlin source that have dependencies on each other. We hope to alleviate this limitation in the future.

== Packaging the application

As usual, the application can be packaged using `./mvnw clean package` and executed using the `-runner.jar` file. You can also build the native executable using `./mvnw package -Pnative`.
