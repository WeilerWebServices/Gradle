=== Building an application in an IDE

If you want to generate IDE metadata configuration for your Play project, you need to apply the appropriate IDE plugin. Gradle supports generating IDE metadata for IDEA only for Play projects at this time.

To generate IDEA's metadata, apply the `idea` plugin along with the `org.gradle.playframework` plugin.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{samplesCodeDir}/configure-compiler/groovy/build.gradle[tag=plugin-definition]
----

Source code generated by routes and Twirl templates cannot be generated by IDEA directly, so changes made to those files will not affect compilation until the next Gradle build. You can run the Play application with Gradle in {uri-gradle-userguide}/command_line_interface.html#sec:continuous_build[continuous build] to automatically rebuild and reload the application whenever something changes.
