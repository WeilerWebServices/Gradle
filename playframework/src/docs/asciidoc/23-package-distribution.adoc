=== Packaging a distribution

Gradle provides the capability to package your Play application so that it can easily be distributed and run in a target environment. The distribution package (zip file) contains the Play binary jars, all dependencies, and generated scripts that set up the classpath and run the application in a Play-specific http://netty.io[Netty] container.

The distribution can be created by running the `dist` lifecycle task and places the distribution in the `$buildDir/distributions` directory. Alternatively, one can validate the contents by running the `stage` lifecycle task which copies the files to the `$buildDir/stage` directory using the layout of the distribution package.
