=== Targeting a Play version

A Play application can be configured to target a certain version of Play. You can configure the Play, Scala and Java version individually with the help of the {uri-plugin-api}/org/gradle/playframework/extensions/PlayPlatform.html[PlayPlatform] which is exposed by the method {uri-plugin-api}/org/gradle/playframework/extensions/PlayExtension.html#platform(org.gradle.api.Action)[PlayExtension.platform(org.gradle.api.Action)].
