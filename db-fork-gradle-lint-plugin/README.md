## Purpose

The Gradle Lint plugin is a pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns of misuse or deprecations in Gradle scripts and related files.  It is inspired by the excellent ESLint tool for Javascript and by the formatting in NPM's [eslint-friendly-formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-friendly-formatter) package.

It assists a centralized build tools team in gently introducing and maintaining a standard build script style across their organization.

## Getting Started

Read the [full documentation](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin/wiki). 

To apply this plugin:

```groovy
buildscript { repositories { jcenter() } }
plugins {
  id 'nebula.lint' version '9.3.2'
}
```
    
*Important:* For now, in a multi-module build you **must** apply lint to the root project, at a minimum.

Alternatively:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories { jcenter() }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.netflix.nebula:gradle-lint-plugin:latest.release'
  }
}


apply plugin: 'nebula.lint'
```

Define which rules you would like to lint against:

```groovy
gradleLint.rules = ['all-dependency'] // add as many rules here as you'd like
```

For an enterprise build, we recommend defining the lint rules in a `init.gradle` script or in a gradle script that is included via the Gradle `apply from` mechanism.

For multimodule projects, we recommend applying the plugin in an allprojects block:

```groovy
allprojects {
  apply plugin: 'nebula.lint'
  gradleLint.rules = ['all-dependency'] // add as many rules here as you'd like
}
```
