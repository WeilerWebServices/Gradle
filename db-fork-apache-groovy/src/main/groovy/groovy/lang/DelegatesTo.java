/**
 * This annotation can be used by API or DSL writers to document parameters which accept a closure.
 * In that case, using this annotation, you can specify what the delegate type of the closure will
 * be. This is important for IDE support.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be used to help the type checker ({@link groovy.transform.TypeChecked})
 * which would not report errors then if the delegate is of the documented type. Of course, it is
 * also compatible with {@link groovy.transform.CompileStatic}.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * // Document the fact that the delegate of the closure will be an ExecSpec
 * ExecResult exec(@DelegatesTo(ExecSpec) Closure closure) { ... }
 * </pre>
