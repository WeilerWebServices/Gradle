= Processing YAML

Groovy has an optional `groovy-yaml` module which provides support for converting between Groovy objects and YAML. The classes dedicated to
YAML serialisation and parsing are found in the `groovy.yaml` package.

[[yaml_yamlslurper]]
== YamlSlurper

`YamlSlurper` is a class that parses YAML text or reader content into Groovy data structures (objects) such as maps, lists and
primitive types like `Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean` and `String`.

The class comes with a bunch of overloaded `parse` methods plus some special methods such as `parseText`
and others. For the next example we will use the `parseText` method. It parses a YAML `String` and recursively converts it to a
list or map of objects. The other `parse*` methods are similar in that they return a YAML `String` but for different parameter
types.

Notice the result is a plain map and can be handled like a normal Groovy object instance. `YamlSlurper` parses the
given YAML as defined by the http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html[YAML Ain’t Markup Language (YAML™)].


As `YamlSlurper` is returning pure Groovy object instances without any special YAML classes in the back, its usage
is transparent. In fact, `YamlSlurper` results conform to GPath expressions. GPath is a powerful expression language
that is supported by multiple slurpers for different data formats (`XmlSlurper` for XML being one example).

[NOTE]
For more details please have a look at the section on <<core-semantics.adoc#gpath_expressions,GPath expressions>>.

The following table gives an overview of the YAML types and the corresponding Groovy data types:

[cols="1,3" options="header"]
|===
|YAML
|Groovy

|string
|`java.lang.String`

|number
|`java.lang.BigDecimal` or `java.lang.Integer`

|object
|`java.util.LinkedHashMap`

|array
|`java.util.ArrayList`

|true
|`true`

|false
|`false`

|null
|`null`

|date
|`java.util.Date` based on the `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ` date format
|===

[NOTE]
Whenever a value in YAML is `null`, `YamlSlurper` supplements it with the Groovy `null` value. This is in contrast to other
YAML parsers that represent a `null` value with a library-provided singleton object.

=== Builders

Another way to create YAML from Groovy is to use `YamlBuilder`. The builder provide a
DSL which allows to formulate an object graph which is then converted to YAML.
