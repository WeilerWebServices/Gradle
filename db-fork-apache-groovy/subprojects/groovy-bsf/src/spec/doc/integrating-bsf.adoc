= Bean Scripting Framework

WARNING: The http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bsf/[Bean Scripting Framework] is an attempt to create an API
to allow calling scripting languages from Java. It hasn't been updated for long and abandoned in favor of the
standard <<jsr223,JSR-223>> API.

The BSF engine for Groovy is implemented by the `org.codehaus.groovy.bsf.GroovyEngine` class. However, that fact is
normally hidden away by the BSF APIs. You just treat Groovy like any of the other scripting languages via the BSF
API.

NOTE: Since Groovy has its own native support for integration with Java, you only need to worry about BSF if you also
want to also be able to call other languages, e.g. https://www.jruby.org/[JRuby] or if you want to remain very
loosely coupled from your scripting language.

== Getting started

Provided you have Groovy and BSF jars in your classpath, you can use the
following Java code to run a sample Groovy script:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-bsf/src/spec/test/BSFSpecTest.java[tags=bsf_simple,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Passing in variables

BSF lets you pass beans between Java and your scripting language. You
can _register_/_unregister_ beans which makes them known to BSF. You can
then use BSF methods to _lookup_ beans as required. Alternatively, you
can _declare_/_undeclare_ beans. This will register them but also make
them available for use directly in your scripting language. This second
approach is the normal approach used with Groovy. Here is an example:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-bsf/src/spec/test/BSFSpecTest.java[tags=bsf_variable_passing,indent=0]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

== Other calling options

The previous examples used the _eval_ method. BSF makes multiple methods
available for your use (see the
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bsf/manual.html[BSF documentation] for more
details). One of the other available methods is _apply_. It allows you
to define an anonymous function in your scripting language and apply
that function to arguments. Groovy supports this function using
closures. Here is an example:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-bsf/src/spec/test/BSFSpecTest.java[tags=bsf_apply,indent=0]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Access to the scripting engine

Although you donâ€™t normally need it, BSF does provide a hook that lets
you get directly to the scripting engine. One of the functions which the
engine can perform is to invoke a single method call on an object. Here
is an example:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-bsf/src/spec/test/BSFSpecTest.java[tags=bsf_access,indent=0]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
