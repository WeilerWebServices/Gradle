= JsonBuilder

Groovy's `JsonBuilder` makes it easy to create Json. For example to create this Json string:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-json/src/spec/test/json/JsonBuilderTest.groovy[tags=json_string,indent=0]
----

you can use a `JsonBuilder` like this:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-json/src/spec/test/json/JsonBuilderTest.groovy[tags=json_builder,indent=0]
----

We use https://github.com/lukas-krecan/JsonUnit[JsonUnit] to check that the builder produced the expected result:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-json/src/spec/test/json/JsonBuilderTest.groovy[tags=json_assert,indent=0]
----

If you need to customize the generated output you can pass a `JsonGenerator` instance when creating a `JsonBuilder`:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{rootProjectDir}/subprojects/groovy-json/src/spec/test/json/JsonBuilderTest.groovy[tags=json_builder_generator,indent=0]
----
